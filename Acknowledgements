We are grateful to CERN, for conducting BL4s and giving us this opportunity to work on particle physics experiments and get an idea of how research feels like at the highest level! We are also immensely thankful to our mentor, Mr. Shyam Wuppuluri for his constant
support and motivation throughout our journey.
