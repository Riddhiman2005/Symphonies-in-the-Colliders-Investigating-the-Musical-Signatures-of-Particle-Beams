# CONCLUSION AND TAKEAWAYS #

With this proposal, we wish to conclude the answers to questions like: <br>
<br>
• Is there geometric symmetry in our findings? If not, what do atypical
patterns indicate? <br>
<br>
• Are all characteristic notes of a particle beam, say a proton beam, the
same? <br>
<br>

• What differentiates the music produced by these beams? Can we use it
as a basis for identifying beam composition? <br>
<br>

Since the empirical access is limited, we can predict that on an average, given an
ensemble of particles, there might be an overall coherence and pattern — even if
the beam has largely same particles, the noise can create this harmony and break
from monotony of similarity. We hope to deepen our understanding of subatomic
trajectories and even discover creative methods to effectively calculate the purity
of the T9 beamline. Art + Physics is an emerging field, and this experiment
could be an amazing model for outreach - our team plans to create a short
documentary, showcasing the beauty of particle physics through audio-visual
means
