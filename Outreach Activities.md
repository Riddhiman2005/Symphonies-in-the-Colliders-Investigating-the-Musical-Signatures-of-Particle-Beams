# Outreach Activities #

*Effective science communication, inclusive classrooms, learning environments
and outreach activities are vital for the development of science and technology,
and upliftment of the society*. Our team members have access to several platforms and necessary resources to undertake scientific exposure initiatives which
can have an impact on the lives of disadvantaged kids.
After performing the experiment at CERN, we plan to create an audiovisual demonstration of Art + Physics (an extended version of our [BL4S video](https://youtu.be/b6IrVvogiFA))
to be shared with schools and local educational clubs and societies. We will
continue scientific enrichment activities through non-profit organizations such
as **FLY ([Fun Learning Youth](https://funlearningyouth.org))** and **RAM ([Raising a Mathematician Foundation](https://www.raisingamathematician.com/))**
which strive to bridge the educational gap and spark scientific interest in school
students. The focus is free sessions, activities, and the use of hands-on learning
as a tool for effective understanding of subjects. Recently, an astronomy seminar
and **hands-on telescope-making session was held in Nashik, India**.

Participating in BL4S is an experience which we will cherish for our lifetime.
Irrespective of the outcome of the competition, the **Pied Pipers** pledge to actively
contribute towards scientific outreach, envisioning a world where scientific ideas,
education and resources are freely accessible to everyone.
