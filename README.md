[Beamline for Schools (BL4S)][(https://beamlineforschools.cern/] is an international competition organized by **CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research)** that aims to engage and inspire young students in the field of particle physics and scientific research. BL4S provides an extraordinary opportunity for school students to propose and conduct their own experiments using the powerful particle accelerators and beamlines at CERN.

BL4S competition contributes to the broader goal of promoting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education. It serves as an inspiration for young students to pursue careers in science, technology, and engineering. By witnessing firsthand the excitement and potential of scientific research, students gain a deeper appreciation for the scientific method and its impact on society. BL4S showcases the relevance and importance of scientific discoveries, motivating students to explore further and contribute to the advancement of knowledge.
