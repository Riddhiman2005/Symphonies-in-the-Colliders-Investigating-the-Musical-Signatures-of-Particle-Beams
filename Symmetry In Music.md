The use of the Fourier transformation can be used to analyze the frequency content of a signal and the various harmonic components of a musical piece. 
If a musical piece exhibits a certain degree of harmonic symmetry, then this can be reflected in the Fourier transform as well.

The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is defined as
