Meet the fabulous seven, the team **Pied Pipers** that's never short on quirk and humor!

First up, we have [**Nikhil Kulkarni**](https://github.com/aaryunik) - the math wizard who loves Enginnering so much that he dreams of one day building a rocket ship to Mars ( and we'all be lucky enough to ride along!). He is a voracious reader and has an active [blog](https://normalisedvector.wordpress.com/) where he publishes interesting stuffs. 
Then, we have Riddhiman Bhattacharya, the Physics enthusiast who's always looking up at the stars and wondering what's out there- he's convinced he'll discover a new galaxy one day! He runs an interesting blog known by the name [Everlasting Quest for Physics](https://everlastingquestforphysics.wordpress.com/) and is particularly famous in sending wishes using Physics and Mathematical theories. 

Next, say hello to Monica, the math and Physics genius from Cambodia who's got a one- track mind set on Princeton - we're pretty sure she'll be running the Mathematics Department by the time she's done.
And then there's [Kalash](https://github.com/kalashb), the master of Math and Linguistics who'll be heading to University of Toronto. She runs a blog - **Neuron Chirps https://theneuronchirp.wordpress.com/**
