Meet the fabulous seven, the team **Pied Pipers** though made up of aficionados for physics, mathematics, engineering and robotics from all around India, as well as one from Cambodia. is never short on quirk and humor!

First up, we have [**Nikhil Kulkarni**](https://github.com/aaryunik) - the math wizard who loves Enginnering so much that he dreams of one day building a rocket ship to Mars ( and we'all be lucky enough to ride along!). He is a voracious reader and has an active [blog](https://normalisedvector.wordpress.com/) where he publishes interesting stuffs. 

Then, we have **Riddhiman Bhattacharya**, the Physics enthusiast who's always looking up at the stars and wondering what's out there- he's convinced he'll discover a new galaxy one day! He runs an interesting blog known by the name [Everlasting Quest for Physics](https://everlastingquestforphysics.wordpress.com/) and is particularly famous in sending wishes using Physics and Mathematical theories. Quite popular among his friends as *Alien In Transit*- due to his versatile character.

Next, say hello to **Monica**, the math and Physics genius from Cambodia who's got a one- track mind set on Princeton - we're pretty sure she'll be running the Mathematics Department by the time she's done.

And then there's [**Kalash**](https://github.com/kalashb) the master of Math & Linguistics, and the winner of the prestigious Lester B Pearson Scholarship, will be heading to University of Toronto. She runs a blog - **Neuron Chirps https://theneuronchirp.wordpress.com/** She's got a way with words that'll make you laugh till your sides hurt!

Don't forget **Sanvi**, our resident robotics queen who's going to build the next big thing in mechatronics - she's already dreaming up designs for robots that'll do everything from cleaning our rooms to cooking our meals (sign us up!). 

And last but not least, we have **Chinmay**( *so he've trust issues with himself only whether his name is Chinmay or not*), the physics and astronomy buff who's also got a passion for military and optics - we're pretty sure he's going to build a telescope that can see all the way to Pluto and back. 

The youngest member of the team - **Izma**, the budding physicist and robotics enthusiast. She may not have started thinking about colleges yet but she's surely gonna prepare her path for it soon!
