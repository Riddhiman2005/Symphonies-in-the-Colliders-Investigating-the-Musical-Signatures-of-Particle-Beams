Meet the fabulous seven, the team **Pied Pipers** though made up of aficionados for physics, mathematics, engineering and robotics from all around India, as well as one from Cambodia. is never short on quirk and humor!

First up, we have [**Nikhil Kulkarni**](https://github.com/aaryunik) - the math wizard who loves Enginnering so much that he dreams of one day building a rocket ship to Mars ( and we'all be lucky enough to ride along!). He is a voracious reader and has an active [blog](https://normalisedvector.wordpress.com/) where he publishes interesting stuffs. 
Then, we have Riddhiman Bhattacharya, the Physics enthusiast who's always looking up at the stars and wondering what's out there- he's convinced he'll discover a new galaxy one day! He runs an interesting blog known by the name [Everlasting Quest for Physics](https://everlastingquestforphysics.wordpress.com/) and is particularly famous in sending wishes using Physics and Mathematical theories. 

Next, say hello to Monica, the math and Physics genius from Cambodia who's got a one- track mind set on Princeton - we're pretty sure she'll be running the Mathematics Department by the time she's done.
And then there's [Kalash](https://github.com/kalashb) the master of Math & Linguistics, and the winner of the prestigious Leston B Pearson Scholarship, will be heading to University of Toronto. She runs a blog - **Neuron Chirps https://theneuronchirp.wordpress.com/**
