The set-up is as follows:




1. Standard set up consisting of the Proton Synchrotron (P S) and Primary
Target (P T), where the beam generated can be positively or negatively
charged.
2. In the test beam area, a Bending Magnet (BM) is placed in the beamâ€™s
path. Each type of particles contained in the beam are diverged to varying
degrees according to their charge and mass. The magnetic field value will
be set to a constant.
3. Two MicroMegas detectors (MM) of dimension 40x40cm are stacked such
that their axes are perpendicularly aligned. This tracks the position of the
diverged particles incident on the 2D plane perpendicular to the original
beam.
4. 16 Lead Crystal Calorimeters (C) are arranged in a 4x4 square. This
covers an area of 40x40cm, thus sufficiently capturing the energy of all
particles passing through MM.
