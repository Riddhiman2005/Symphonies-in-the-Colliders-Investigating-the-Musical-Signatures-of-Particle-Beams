The set-up is as follows:

1.  Standard set up consisting of the Proton Synchrotron (P S) and Primary
    Target (*PT*), where **the beam generated can be positively or negatively
    charged**.
2.  In the test beam area, a Bending Magnet (*BM*) is placed in the beamâ€™s
    path. Each type of particles contained in the beam are diverged to varying
    degrees according to their charge and mass. The magnetic field value will
    be set to a constant.
3.  Two MicroMegas detectors (MM) of dimension 40x40cm are stacked such
    that their axes are perpendicularly aligned. This tracks the position of the
    diverged particles incident on the 2D plane perpendicular to the original
    beam.
4.  16 Lead Crystal Calorimeters (C) are arranged in a 4x4 square. This
    covers an area of 40x40cm, thus sufficiently capturing the energy of all
    particles passing through MM.
 
 Our experiment aims to compare the musical notes for different types of
beams, for varying magnetic field, and for different ways of calculating the
frequency or the loudness of the note.
