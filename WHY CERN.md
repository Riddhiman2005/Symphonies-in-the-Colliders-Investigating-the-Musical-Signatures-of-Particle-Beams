# WHY CERN #



The **Pied Pipers** are a group of high-school students from across India and
Cambodia with varied interests and experiences but a common love for physics!
Visiting CERN has been THE dream for each one of us. While working on
this project, we were able to catch a glimpse of the incredulous depth of particle
physics. The idea of getting a chance to not just witness, but actually contribute
to advancement of the sciences is mind-blowing! We are incredibly excited to
explore the massive accelerators at CERN, learn about different projects and
implement our experiment on a grander scale. As **Albert Einstein’s** famous
quote goes:

*'After a certain high level of technical skill is achieved, science and
art tend to coalesce in esthetics, plasticity, and form.’*

In the vast universe that surrounds us, art and science are intertwined
threads which weave a tapestry of beauty and wonder. Our goal is to unite particle physics with music - to give voice to the harmonies of subatomic particles.
Hence we propose a study of the variation and characteristic musical interpretation of particle beams; while also addressing a pragmatic aspect: studying the
composition of the CERN-T9 beamline.
